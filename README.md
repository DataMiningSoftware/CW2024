## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Implemented but Not Working Properly**

1. **Boss Shield Mechanic**  
   - The boss‚Äôs shield is implemented and functional, but it fails to appear on screen when activated.

2. **Enemy Death Animation**  
   - Enemy planes have a death animation with a yellow fading effect, but it doesn‚Äôt trigger during normal gameplay. The animation only works when the `removeDestroyedActors(enemyUnits);` line is removed from `Scene_Properties.java` (line 367), which causes the enemy to live on forever.

3. **Level Border**  
   - The level border blocks the player from going too far to the right, but projectiles don‚Äôt disappear once they pass the border.

4. **Player Shield Mechanic**  
   - A limited shield can negate enemy projectiles, but its charge depletes over time and recovers gradually. The mechanic was implemented but does not appear when the keybind is pressed during the game loop.

5. **Equipped Gun Indicator**  
   - A box with a text indicator showing the currently equipped gun does not appear, despite being correctly integrated into the game loop.

6. **Pause Menu Screen**  
   - The Pause Menu displays buttons for *Resume*, *Restart*, and *Quit to Main Menu*. However:
     - The *Resume* button leaves the player stationary while enemies move. Only pressing the *Space* key restarts the game from level 1.
     - The *Quit to Main Menu* button causes two instances of the main menu to open. Initially, the main menu alignment was off, but even after fixing it, the second instance‚Äôs buttons do not work, while the buttons on the first instance are functional.

## üö´ **Features Not Implemented**

1. **Multiplayer Mode**  
   - A planned feature for multiple players to join the game. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, it was not implemented.

2. **Settings Menu**  
   - While the idea for a settings menu was conceived, it only included volume and difficulty adjusters. It was deprioritized in favor of other features and eventually forgotten.

3. **Endless Mode**  
   - A mode with constant enemy aggression and no way to win. Ultimately, the idea was scrapped, as it seemed purposeless.

4. **Advanced Shield Animations**  
   - Although the shield follows the boss, planned animations for its activation and deactivation were not fully implemented.

5. **Cutscenes**  
   - Short videos or gifs to immerse the player in the narrative were considered, but time constraints led to their exclusion.

6. **Power-Ups**  
   - Power-ups were envisioned as three transformations, each with a unique buff:  
     - **Yellow**: Base form  
     - **Red**: Power form (extra 2 hearts)  
     - **Green**: Speed form (increased movement speed)  
     - **Blue**: Tiny mode (easier to dodge projectiles)  
     However, scaling issues, difficulties with the `ImageView` class, and persistent errors caused frustration, ultimately leading to the feature being abandoned.

7. **Random Pickups**  
   - Floating objects that could grant hearts, buffs, or money were considered, but abandoned due to the risk of overstimulating the screen, particularly in the first two levels.

8. **Boss Health and Shield Bars**  
   - An indicator for the boss's health and shield was planned, but despite extensive work, it couldn't be initialized due to null pointer issues. As a result, I opted for damage indicators and console messages.

## Unexpected Problems

1. **Shield Mechanism**:
    - The shield mechanism wasn't working properly with the boss. Despite reinitializing the shield class and method, I encountered issues with its functionality. While I was able to make the shield work in terms of its mechanics, the visual aspect of the shield not appearing was a challenge. Changing the boss's image also didn't resolve the issue. As a workaround, I implemented a solution where the damage indicator wouldn't activate while the shield was active, ensuring that no damage would be reflected until the shield was gone.

2. **Boss Health Bar**:
    - The boss health bar became a persistent problem, often resulting in null exceptions despite numerous attempts to implement it. Instead of continuing to face these errors, I introduced a damage indicator as a workaround, allowing players to still see if they were dealing damage to the boss even though the health bar itself wasn't functioning.

3. **Different Gun Types**:
    - This feature posed a significant challenge but was ultimately one of the aspects I am most proud of. Initially, understanding how projectiles worked and how they were fired was difficult. I struggled with configuring their direction, as my early attempts resulted in projectiles shooting upwards from below the window border. After much trial and error, I was able to achieve the desired functionality, enabling different gun types to behave as intended.

4. **Gun Box for Current Gun Indicator**:
    - Initially, I was able to implement the feature where the active gun type was displayed in a box at the bottom center of the screen. However, an issue arose when I used an event handler for the gun keybinds, which inadvertently affected the movement controls as well. Since the keybinds were initialized simultaneously, this resulted in choppy movement, non-functional projectiles, and difficulty navigating the game. I had to address this problem, sacrificing gameplay fluidity in the process.

5. **Screen Resolution**:
    - Screen resolution and fullscreen mode posed an unexpected challenge. Whenever the player advanced to the next level, the fullscreen mode would reinitialize, causing the screen to exit fullscreen and resize, accompanied by the annoying "press F11 to exit fullscreen" message. After considerable effort, I found a solution by reinitializing the fullscreen windowed mode, which resolved the issue and ensured a smoother transition between levels.

6. **Pause Overlay and Main Menu**:
    - Initially, the pause overlay was implemented with a keybind to pause and unpause the game. I later added a mini main menu within the pause screen to give users more control. While the implementation itself was straightforward, I encountered several issues. The most notable problem was that when resuming the game, only certain entities resumed their behavior while the player‚Äôs plane was immobile. Additionally, the "Quit to Main Menu" button caused the background image to distort, rendering the main menu screen inoperable. I tried multiple techniques to prevent the background image from running off-screen, but it didn't work, so I resorted to launching a second instance of the main menu, which was not ideal.

7. **Projectiles**:
    - I aimed to create projectiles that could do more than just move in a straight line, and I succeeded in developing projectiles that actively tracked the player's position. This was a challenge, and I was one of the first among my peers to achieve this. The most difficult part was figuring out why the position of the active actor couldn't be passed to the enemy class. After considerable effort, I was able to make this functionality work, and while I'm not entirely sure how I accomplished it, I am proud of the outcome.

8. **UserPlane Movement**:
    - I wanted to introduce more dynamic movement for the player, incorporating vertical movement as well as horizontal. Initially, I didn't expect this to be such a crucial element. Passing coordinates for the active actors turned out to be difficult, and I ran into issues where certain methods could access the coordinates while others couldn't. After resolving this, I focused on smoothing out the movement, but I inadvertently made it too smooth, causing the plane to glide. After much adjustment, I left it as an intended feature, providing a unique gameplay experience.

9. **Scene_Properties**:
    - The `Scene_Properties` class, which controls the game loop, became more integral to the game‚Äôs structure than I initially realized. It was challenging to keep track of what methods were being passed or received, and I didn‚Äôt realize I had accumulated over 600 lines of code. Refactoring this class to manage the game‚Äôs flow properly took two full days, but I eventually got it working as it is today. This experience taught me the importance of careful planning and managing data efficiently in the future.

By addressing these unforeseen issues, the game reached a stable and functional state, though there is still room for further refinement in certain areas. üòä
